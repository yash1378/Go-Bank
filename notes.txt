In Go's `net/http` package, the order of setting headers and writing the status code is important because once you call [`WriteHeader`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fglitch%2FDesktop%2FGo-CRUD%2FlearningGo%2FAnthony-GG-tutorials%2FGo_Bank%2Fapi.go%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A66%2C%22character%22%3A3%7D%7D%5D%2C%227efd91ab-b67e-4d70-a1bd-1ea036d16a79%22%5D "Go to definition"), the headers are sent to the client and cannot be modified.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Setting Headers**: When you call [`w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fglitch%2FDesktop%2FGo-CRUD%2FlearningGo%2FAnthony-GG-tutorials%2FGo_Bank%2Fapi.go%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A65%2C%22character%22%3A1%7D%7D%5D%2C%227efd91ab-b67e-4d70-a1bd-1ea036d16a79%22%5D "Go to definition"), you are setting the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`. This header is stored but not yet sent to the client.

2. **Writing Status Code**: When you call [`w.WriteHeader(status)`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fglitch%2FDesktop%2FGo-CRUD%2FlearningGo%2FAnthony-GG-tutorials%2FGo_Bank%2Fapi.go%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A65%2C%22character%22%3A1%7D%7D%5D%2C%227efd91ab-b67e-4d70-a1bd-1ea036d16a79%22%5D "Go to definition"), the status code and all headers set so far are sent to the client. After this point, any changes to headers will not affect the response already sent.

If you reverse the order:

1. **Writing Status Code First**: When you call [`w.WriteHeader(status)`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fglitch%2FDesktop%2FGo-CRUD%2FlearningGo%2FAnthony-GG-tutorials%2FGo_Bank%2Fapi.go%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A65%2C%22character%22%3A1%7D%7D%5D%2C%227efd91ab-b67e-4d70-a1bd-1ea036d16a79%22%5D "Go to definition") first, the default `Content-Type` header (`text/plain`) is sent to the client along with the status code.

2. **Setting Headers After**: When you then call [`w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fglitch%2FDesktop%2FGo-CRUD%2FlearningGo%2FAnthony-GG-tutorials%2FGo_Bank%2Fapi.go%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A65%2C%22character%22%3A1%7D%7D%5D%2C%227efd91ab-b67e-4d70-a1bd-1ea036d16a79%22%5D "Go to definition"), it changes the header in the server's memory, but it does not affect the response already sent to the client.

Thus, the correct order is to set the headers first and then write the status code to ensure the headers are sent correctly.
